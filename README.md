# medical-medium-chemtrails-podcast-notes

I used `pandoc` on https://old.reddit.com/r/medicalmedium/comments/1jzfjws/001_chemtrails_the_sky_is_falling_episode_notes/ and then replaced `\` characters and dropped a bit text at the bottom.

```bash
pandoc -w markdown --wrap=none a.html -o output.md
```
