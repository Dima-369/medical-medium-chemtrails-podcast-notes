# Chemtrail Podcast Notes

# Hiding in Plain Sight

-   There are contrails, and then there are man-made poison trails - chemtrails
-   Contrails have to do with heat and vapor from the engines creating streaks in higher altitude in colder temperatures. They dissipate fast and only leave a small streak behind a plane
-   Chemtrails trail behind a plane for many, many miles and last a long time

# History of Chemtrails

-   In the years before WWI broke out, the chemical industry was just beginning to grow
-   World War I created a ton of demand and really ignited the industry
-   Chemical byproducts are the chemicals produced as waste in the process of creating another chemical. These can be very toxic and usually are in much larger proportions than the ultimate chemical that is produced
-   Everything manmade produces some chemical byproduct
-   A huge overflow of chemical byproduct was created in these first few decades, which they disposed of in lakes, oceans, and rivers.
-   But they knew if they kept doing this, they would pretty quickly kill these bodies of water. And they would die globally, and once completely dead could not be brought back
-   So the dumping slowed down in the 60s, and more and more storage bins of chemical byproduct and botched batches started to accumulate. Billions and billions and trillions of gallons
-   They tried storing it in landfills, but when it would rain there would be leakage and they'd have the same problem with lakes and oceans
-   It would take a massive, massive amount of land to store all of it. There's just not enough - it would take over the earth
-   So to deal with this problem, a private deal (like the protein law deal, or the autoimmune law deal) was made in the 1960s without any public say or input
-   As part of this deal, planes were hollowed out and huge tanks were installed in them. Old passenger planes
-   These planes are filled with the toxic waste chemicals, and they spray them in flight to dispose of them. They do this all over the planet
-   They travel on their own flight patterns, and land in private airports
-   They're not military, nothing to do with any governments. It is a whole other organization built by private contractors for the chemical industries
-   It was thought in the very beginning that they'd be in very minute concentrations and it'd be safe to dispose of them this way
-   This slow release, slow dissipation does at least give the environment some time to adapt and makes the shock somewhat less. The plan was also to have it stay in the clouds and for rainwater to neutralize it, but it doesn't stay up there

# Chemtrails in the present day

-   The planes are running nonstop all day and all night
-   The chemtrails that you see are not coming down on you - if you can see it, it's miles away. The one that is coming down on you you can't see.
-   The pilot will flip a switch to turn the pumps for the tanks on and off. This is why trails can start and stop
-   It's gone beyond the process of just disposing of these chemicals. A dark second intention has developed: they are heightened at times when people are outside more, e.g. holidays and nice days when lots of people are out.
-   Chemtrails settle and concentrate in the moisture of the early morning dew - important to avoid it. They also are more concentrated in the air under the treeline in the morning as well, before it's been blown out. We can breathe it in and absorb it through our pores
-   Governments have absolutely nothing to do with chemtrails, and they have no power to stop them. It's a private club with immense, immense power
-   How do you solve a problem that nobody acknowledges? That is above all laws?
-   SoC told AW decades ago when he was young: The man-poison club is an evil machine. You don't stop it and you don't fight it, because you'll never win, at least not that way. You have to accept it and then you rise above it
-   Flight towers just have to ignore these planes even though they see them show up on radar
-   Governments just pretend like they don't exist

# Chemtrail consequences

-   Strange forms of bacteria, mold, and toxic algae grow in the old chemical waste tanks. New allergens we've never experienced. It is because when they spend decades in these tanks with these chemicals, they adapt to survive and become something very different.
-   This is the reason for the toxic algal blooms you hear about in the news - the red tide
-   Acid rain is not just about smog - chemtrails are a big factor. A lot does stay in the clouds, and then it comes down when there's a rain. That's why it's important to avoid the rain
-   Our skies are hazy blue rather than the rich, clear blues skies of the past because of chemtrails. Older people remember what the sky used to look like
-   Chemtrails can shadow areas of the world by blocking out the sun. This can change the weather and climate. This goes deeper than known cloud-seeding techniques for manipulating weather
-   They cause droughts in areas that shouldn't have droughts, and more rain in areas that shouldn't have much rain
-   It can affect thunderstorms, hurricanes, and tornadoes
-   The polar caps are melting because of chemtrails
-   Smog + pollution are bad, but they are nothing compared to chemtrails
-   Chemtrails are what is responsible when entire flocks of birds die, thousands of birds, falling out of the sky at once. It's when they hit a thick pocket of the vapor before it's dispersed enough
-   The public is only aware of some of the instances where this happens - it often happens in remote areas that are not populated by humans
-   They are devastating the bees as well
-   When you encounter a bee that is docile, crawling around, dying a slow death - it is often from chemtrail toxicity
-   Birds and bees are the canaries in the coal mine - the next to go are dragonflies, butterflies, and schools of fish
-   Chemicals that are dropped can pool in certain areas of the ocean that are more stagnant. Fish can die instantly when they hit these
-   Chemtrails get everywhere - they get on our fields, on everything we eat, in the soil (destroying soil borne microorganisms, and depleting the soils of zinc)
-   They accumulate in animals, and won't show up on tests - 90% of the chemicals coming out of these planes are not known to public science and won't be tested for
-   Our zinc deficiency created by soil depletion from chemtrails is a big reason why people are getting sick with viruses
-   Long after we are here, the oceans will die and turn completely red
-   Chemtrails are on track to get worse and worse over time. These fleets are massive and growing larger
-   Chemtrails will be the end of birds way down the line

# Update: Progress + Hope

An important note: AW emphasized in a more recent podcast (083 Toxic Fog) that we have the tools to clear whatever they spray faster than it comes in our bodies.

But he also said in that podcast that "someone might stop them someday - someday soon" in reference to the people dumping chemtrails. It seems that maybe things have changed, and that new possibilities have opened since he recorded the original podcast in 2020.

Many take these comments to be referring to RFK Jr, who is now Secretary for Health and Human Services (HHS) in the US. This department oversees the NIH, FDA, and the CDC among others, and manages a $2 trillion budget.

RFK Jr has said "we are going to stop this crime" in relation to chemtrails, and he had the guy who made a documentary about chemtrails called *The Dimming*, Dane Wigington, on hisÂ podcasts ago. He's encouraged states to pass legislation banning geoengineering as well:

24 States move to ban geoengineering our climate by dousing our citizens, our waterways and landscapes with toxins. This is a movement every MAHA needs to support. HHS will do its part.
